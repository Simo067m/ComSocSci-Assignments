    "_What are pros and cons of the custom-made data used in Centola's experiment (the first study presented in the lecture) and the ready-made data used in Nicolaides's study (the second study presented in the lecture)? You can support your arguments based on the content of the lecture and the information you read in Chapter 2.3 of the book (answer in max 150 words)._\n",
    "\n",
    ">- **custom-made data**: The pros are that specific hypotheses can be investigated within a  controlled environment without any external influences. However, this control can also be a disadvantage, as the created clusters were created randomly and might only artificially fit the definition of friend group and the studied social network definitions, and people might behave differently as the people that use are not really their friends.\n",
    ">- **ready-made data**: The advantages are that a big dataset is already available and ecologically valid. However, the researchers do not have any control over how the data is collected and this collection purpose might not match the needs of the research. Nevertheless, this can also be seen as a potential pro as this could lead to more creative and innovative methods used by the researchers which might in the next step create new findings outside of the standard procedure.\n",

    "### Q2\n",
    "_How do you think these differences can influence the interpretation of the results in each study? (answer in max 150 words)_\n",
    "> These differences can mainly influence the limitations of a study. In Centola's study, the degree of realism within the experimental setup can influence the interpretation. While these results were observed within an artificially created network, it has to be investigated if these outcomes can be generalized to other naturally formed networks. In Nicolaide's study, other effects other than the contagiousness of the network could be the reason for the change in running behaviour. While there were some tests applied to check the outcome, for example, the weather check, it is still always questionable if the \"right\" testing has been done. (100 words)"

The fact that the average strength of the nodes is higher than the degree, suggests that each author has collaborated with the same co-authors on at least 2 papers and not just one.
