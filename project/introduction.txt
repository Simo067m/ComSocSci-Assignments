The goal of our investigation was to find out more about the movie industry than what is currently known by the general public. This has been done by analyzing data collected from the movie database (TMDB) https://www.themoviedb.org/.
Data collected and analyzed includes movies and their summaries, the crews producing the movies and the actors acting in them. We aimed to explore the connections between the movies, crew and cast using a bipartite network. We aim to discover the figures who are the most diverse in genres, and how much an actor sticks to a genre.
Then, to get a greater understanding of the movie's natural communities, their genres, a textual analysis has been performed on this community partition.
